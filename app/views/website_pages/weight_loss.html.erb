                        <h5 class="text bold margin-top margin-bottom">Why should I join your program?</h5>
                            My program is proven. It has worked for me and many other patients. It is based on scientifically proven methods and the latest medical information from obesity research. I am a Family physician who is a member of the ASBP (*link to ASBP.org*). I follow the Bariatric guidelines and attend regularly sponsored activities by the ASBP. Your weight loss is supervised by a qualified physician who can assess all your medical issues.
                        <h5 class="text bold margin-top margin-bottom">Can I continue to see my regular physician or healthcare provider?</h5>
                            Yes. In fact, I encourage it. I will see you as a weight loss specialist. I function as a consult like a cardiologist, etc. I will address issues you may have that relate to obesity and its co-morbidities. You need to see your regular physician for your routine health maintenance and management of other chronic illnesses for which you are being treated. I will communicate with your referring physician regularly so they know what recommendations and medications I recommend.
                     
                        <h5 class="text bold margin-top margin-bottom">How is your bariatric program different from what is offered by my regular physician?</h5>
                            I have obtained extensive training in obesity and its related disorders meaning I am better qualified to treat obesity just like a cardiologist is better qualified to treat heart disease in some cases. I treat patients who have been unsuccessful in the treatment recommended by their primary care provider. I also serve as a consultant to physicians who need someone with more experience to manage their patients with obesity related disorders.
                        <h5 class="text bold margin-top margin-bottom">How much weight can I expect to lose in the first month?</h5>
                            Most of my patients lose an average of 5 pounds or more within the first 2-4 weeks if they follow the program. Depending on what combination of medications and supplements you are on along with exercise and your eating habits, you may lose significantly more. The weight loss is probably less than you would get with a fad diet because my goal is a gradual and steady weight loss which you can maintain without feeling deprived.
                        <h5 class="text bold margin-top margin-bottom">Do you use recommend meal replacements or low calorie diets?</h5>
                            I generally don’t but if that is what works for you, I will work with it. From my experience, I have found that those are difficult to maintain. No one is going to eat protein bars or milk shakes as a meal for the rest of their life. My philosophy is to get you used to making better food choices from what is available in your local grocery store. Moreover, many of those bars, shakes and packaged foods are not as healthy as you may think.
                        <h5 class="text bold margin-top margin-bottom">I have tried a low fat diet but I am unable to lose weight. Why is that so?</h5>
                           I could not lose or maintain weight loss on a low fat diet either. That is why I became a bariatrician to explore alternatives. As a bariatrician, I am better able to help you because of my training and the many resources available to me.
                        <h5 class="text bold margin-top margin-bottom">Do you use Phentermine and is it safe?</h5>
                            Yes. I use Phentermine and it is safe. The problem with “Fen-Phen” was with Fenfluramine, another drug that was combined with Phentermine. Fenfluramine was taken off the market but Phentermine has always been available. It has been available since the 1950s and is the most cost effective medication available for weight management. It needs to be prescribed and managed by a Bariatician who is adequately trained to manage the disease of obesity.
                        <h5 class="text bold margin-top margin-bottom">Can I become addicted to the weight loss pills?</h5>
                           The probability of psychological dependence is low when anorectics are used in medical weight reduction and maintenance programs appropriately supervised by bariatricians. (ASBP, anorectic usage guidelines.)
                        <h5 class="text bold margin-top margin-bottom">Can I use diet bills if I have a medical problem like diabetes, hypertension or high cholesterol?</h5>
                            Certain medical problems often associated with obesity such as diabetes, hypertension and most serum lipid abnormalities usually respond favorably to weight loss. The anorectics (weight loss medications) may be useful in helping patients with these conditions achieve meaningful weight loss. As noted by Albert Stunkard, M.D., Professor of Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania, “There are strong positive indications for the long term use of appetite suppressants. Many obese, hypertensive and diabetic patients can control their conditions by weight loss. Unfortunately, however, many of them cannot lose weight by diet alone. As a result, they are forced to rely on long term use of medication to control their hypertension, diabetes, and other conditions. If these patients must receive long term medication, they may well be better off on appetite suppressants than on the usual remedies.” (ASBP, anorectic usage guidelines.)
                        <h5 class="text bold margin-top margin-bottom">I have depression. Can I still join your program?</h5>
                           The obese patient may be prone to depression. In such cases the anorectics may be helpful in the patient’s weight loss program, which in turn may help with the depressive state. Patients with significant depressive symptoms should be considered for antidepressant therapy. (ASBP, anorectic usage guidelines.)
                       <h5 class="text bold margin-top margin-bottom">How much weight do I need to lose to reduce my health risk?</h5>
                           The evidence is increasingly strong that significant health benefits may occur with a 5-10% weight loss that is maintained. In addition, helping patients avoid the tendency to gradually increase weight while getting older may, in and of itself, be a significant health benefit. Also, even a modest weight loss is frequently associated with an increased sense of self worth. (ASBP, anorectic usage guidelines.)
